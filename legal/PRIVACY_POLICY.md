## Summary

**In Plain Language:**

We collect very little data - mainly your public wallet address for payments and your approximate location to check you're not in a sanctioned country. Everything else stays on your phone. We don't track you, we don't show ads, and we never sell your data. If you want to delete everything, just uninstall the App. Blockchain transactions are permanent and public - that's how blockchains work.
